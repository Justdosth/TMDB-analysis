# Movie Profitability Prediction Project

## Overview
The Movie Profitability Prediction Project aims to predict whether a movie will be profitable based on various features such as budget, revenue, genre, production company, etc. This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, modeling, and the development of a recommender system.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about several thousand movies, including features such as budget, genres, production companies, release date, revenue, etc. The dataset can be found [here](link_to_dataset).

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the analysis and modeling process.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
